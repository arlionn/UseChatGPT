| Given some basic <br> prompts, the GPTs aid <br> the researcher in <br> ideation, formulating the <br> specific research <br> question, and conducting <br> preliminary literature <br> review (Perplexity, Elicit, <br> ScholarAI) | Given the chosen <br> research question, <br> suggestion of <br> experimental design, <br> treatments and <br> hypotheses to test and <br> which setting is the most <br> appropriate to tackle the <br> question (lab, field, <br> lab-in-field) | Given the targeted <br> participants, the GPTs <br> tailor the wordings of the <br> experimental elicitations, <br> write instructions and <br> comprehension checks. | Given the chosen <br> experimental design, and <br> the chosen wording, <br> GPTs generate the <br> experimental code in the <br> desired language <br> (Qualtrics, O-Tree, Z-Tree) <br> and the related <br> documentation (IRB, <br> replication package, <br> readme file) | Once the code is <br> generated, the GPTs <br> checks whether the code <br> contains technical error, <br> simulate focus groups <br> and pilots |
